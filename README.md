## Disclaimer

The code is mostly 💩 (Pierre's expert opinion as an instructor of Object Oriented Design & Analysis) and should not be seen/used as an example of good practices.

We started this GameJam (design  builandd a game … in 48h 🤯) without any prior knowledge or experience with [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/), and more generally in game building (different mechanics, interaction, and requirements than what we've done until now). This explains why we did not use GameplayKit and why ended up doing some horrible things that rightfully deserve the term *poop* emoji.

But such is the cost of starting from nothing and shipping under 48h with an unknonw/unmastered framework and with no help (pride is just as bad as stress ; not sure which of the two to blame for not relying on some tutorials or any kind of help).

Despite this terrible judgement of the code itself, one must say:

  1. It works. That's rule #1. So congrats to us 🤗
  2. So this was fun and we had a good time. Thank you to the #PGJ2020 team.
  3. Code is not everything and the actual game design, music, and graphics are dope! 🤩

## Special Thanks

  * To all involved in the #PGJ2020 – organizers, jury, coaches, and contestants alike. This was fun.
  * To Chloé who joined us late Friday night and who is responsibly for making the game look like a game. 👍
  * To our spouses and family. Indeed, our team had an age avegerage greater than 40… Spouses were left to manage the younger ones. ❤️
